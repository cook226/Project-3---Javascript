# Project Overview

This project is a JavaScript enhancement for a prebuilt website template. I focused solely on implementing the interactive features via JavaScript, showcasing my ability to work seamlessly with both jQuery and vanilla JavaScript (using querySelector). Although the website isnâ€™t fully functional, this project served as a proof-of-concept to establish my skills in asynchronous API calls, event-driven programming, and modern JavaScript practices.

The **main.js** file demonstrates a range of skills including:

- **Dynamic Greetings & Live Clock:** Adjusting greetings based on the time of day and updating the clock every second.
- **Weather Integration:** Fetching geolocation-based weather data via the OpenWeatherMap API with robust error handling.
- **Interactive Gallery & Navigation:** Implementing a dynamic image gallery with thumbnail selection and responsive navigation menu toggling.
- **Product Filtering:** Displaying and filtering products (paid vs. free) with DOM manipulation and event handling.

This project highlights my proficiency in creating interactive, user-friendly interfaces while working with a prebuilt template.
