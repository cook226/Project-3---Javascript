# Project Overview

This project is a JavaScript enhancement for a prebuilt website template. I focused solely on implementing the interactive features via JavaScript, showcasing my ability to work seamlessly with both jQuery and vanilla JavaScript (using querySelector). Although the website isn’t fully functional, this project served as a proof-of-concept to establish my skills in asynchronous API calls, event-driven programming, and modern JavaScript practices.

The **main.js** file demonstrates a range of skills including:

- **Dynamic Greetings & Live Clock:** Adjusting greetings based on the time of day and updating the clock every second.
- **Weather Integration:** Fetching geolocation-based weather data via the OpenWeatherMap API with robust error handling.
- **Interactive Gallery & Navigation:** Implementing a dynamic image gallery with thumbnail selection and responsive navigation menu toggling.
- **Product Filtering:** Displaying and filtering products (paid vs. free) with DOM manipulation and event handling.

This project highlights my proficiency in creating interactive, user-friendly interfaces while working with a prebuilt template.
